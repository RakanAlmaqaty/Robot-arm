# Robot-arm
A robotic arm is a type of mechanical arm, usually programmable, with similar functions to a human arm; the arm may be the sum total of the mechanism or may be part of a more complex robot.

Installation steps : First, give the basic shape , And then add the waist , and then install the piece arm 01 , And on top of it, install the piece arm 02 , And then I put the gripper at the end above.
